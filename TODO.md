- test all docker images [tested: 2/5]
  - fix commands for fourplayers/openclaw, test more
- test on Linux (should work)
- now that pairing works -> maybe we dont need the allowInsecure + reboot hack?
- test other options in wizzard (remote gateway, tailsafe, loopback, etc)
- auto security check skills as post install step
- remove the bundled skills that comes with openclaw!!! Heard of Twitter incident?
- NEW: allow to select/deselect my selected skills to install inside wizzard
- move 'ywizz' library to a separate repo
- add 'docs' reader inside wizzard. Or Deepwiki?
- build openclaw from source option using Dockerfile?
